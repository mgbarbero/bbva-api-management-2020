## API Deployment

### Deploying APIs to OpenShift

* Audience: Developers, Architects, System Administrators, Operators

## Overview

The code which implements any of the APIs in your organization is part of it's software infrastructure. This code needs to be well managed since it may need to scale to handle high volume, deployed in multiple locations and updated smoothly. In this lab you will learn how to deploy API backend code on the OpenShift container management platform which provides state of the art tools for managing deployed code.

### Why Red Hat?

Red Hat OpenShift is one of the leading container management platforms available in the market. It is based on the highly popular Kubernetes Open Source project which Red Hat is a leading contributor to. 

## Lab Instructions

### Step 1: Deploying Fuse-based APIs

1. Open a browser window and navigate to:

    ```bash
    www.openshift.com
    ```

1. Create a free account

1. Log into OpenShift using your user and password. Click on **Sign In**.

    ![01-login](images/deploy-01.png "OpenShift Login")

1. You are now in OpenShift's main page. Create a project

1. Deploy the MySQL database

1. From your main project page, click **Administrator**, then click **Developer**.

1. **Add** and then **Database**

1. Select **Mysql** and then **Instantiate Template**

1. Fill the following vars for the database

    * MySQL Connection Username: **dbuser**
    * MySQL Connection Password: **password**
    * MySQL Database Name: **sampledb**
    * MySQL root user Password: **password**

1. Deploy the locations service

1. From your main project page, click **Add and then YAML**.

1. Paste the content of the **Red Hat Fuse 7.0 Camel with Spring Boot** template from **https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/bbva-api-management/blob/master/locations-api-template.json** then **Create**

1. From your main project page, click **Add and then From Catalog**.

1. Select **Red Hat Fuse 7.0 Camel with Spring Boot** and then **Instantiate Template**

1. Fill in the configuration information with your API implementation github repo details:

    * Application Name: **location-service**
    * Git Repository URL: **https://github.com/YOUR_REPO/bbva-api-management**
    * Git Repository context: **/projects/location-service**
    * Git Reference: **master**

1. Click the **Create >** button.
    
1. Your service will be provisioned in a moment.

### Step 2: Test Location API Service

We now have a working Location API Service implementation listening for requests. We will use an online cURL tool to test it.

1. Open a browser window and navigate to:

    ```bash
    https://onlinecurl.com/
    ```

1. Enter the following URL: 

    ```bash
    http://YOUR_LOCATION_SERVICE_ROUTE/locations/1
    ```

1. Click the **START YOUR CURL** button.

    ![13-curl-service](images/deploy-13.png "cURL Service")

1. The page will load the response information from the service. You will be able to see the *RESPONSE HEADERS* and the actual *RESPONSE_BODY*.

    ![14-curl-response](images/deploy-14.png "cURL Response")

*Congratulations!* You successfully deployed your teams Location API Service implementations into OpenShift using Red Hat Fuse 7.0 Spring Boot template.

## Steps Beyond

Sometimes, something more complex could be making your deployment fail. You can take a deeper look in to the log by clicking the pod and changing to the *Logs* tab. From OpenShift you can also connect to the container through the provided *Terminal* tab.

## Summary

In this lab you were able to launch a new software service which implements and API and manage it using the OpenShift platform. Subsequently you were able to call the API to see if it was really deployed and accessible in the right place.
